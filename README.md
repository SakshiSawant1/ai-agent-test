result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)

This code defines two functions: `welcome_message()` which prints a greeting, and `add_numbers(a, b)` which returns the sum of two numbers. The `welcome_message()` function is called first, followed by calling `add_numbers(3, 4)` and printing the result. The purpose of this code seems to be a simple demonstration of function definitions and execution in Python.
