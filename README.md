# AI Agent Test File

## Problem Statement
This code provides a simple test file for an AI Agent. It demonstrates how to write a basic Python script that includes a welcome message and a function to add two numbers. The main goal is to showcase the core functionality of a Python script and how it can be used for testing purposes.

## ⚙️ Logic & Core Functionality
The script consists of two main functions:

1. `welcome_message()`: This function prints a welcome message to the console, greeting the user and indicating that this is a test file for the AI Agent.

2. `add_numbers(a, b)`: This function takes two numbers as input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

The script then calls the `welcome_message()` function to display the welcome message when the script is executed. It also includes a new feature that prints an additional message to the console, indicating that it is a new feature.

## File Structure
The project consists of a single Python file named `test_file.py`. The file contains the following functions and code:

- `welcome_message()`: Prints the welcome message to the console.
- `add_numbers(a, b)`: Takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
- `welcome_message()`: Calls the `welcome_message()` function to display the welcome message.
- `print("This is a new feature")`: Prints an additional message to the console, indicating that it is a new feature.

## Latest Updates
The recent changes to the code include:

- Adding a `print("This is a new feature")` statement to demonstrate adding new features to the script.

These updates enhance the functionality of the script by providing an example of how new features can be added to the code.

## Running the Script
To run the script, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the `test_file.py` file is located, and execute the following command:

```
python test_file.py
```

This will execute the script and display the output in the console, including the welcome message and the sum of the provided numbers, along with the new feature message.
